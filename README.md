<h1>Model checking through contextual unfolding</h1>
<p>
    This piece of software is an experimentation of model checking through
    contextual petri nets (petri nets with read-arc). Here we use a piece of 
    software (the unfolder) that was previously developed by Alessandro Bruni
    in his master thesis. All copyrights are given in the source code.
